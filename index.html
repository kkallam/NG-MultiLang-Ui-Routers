A mixin lets you make groups of CSS declarations that you want to reuse throughout your site. You can even pass in values to make your mixin more flexible.

You can watch either individual files or entire directories. In addition, you can watch folders or directories with the --watch flag. An example of running Sass while watching an entire directory is the following:
