Or, in the case of end-to-end solutions provider Tekzenit, you find yourself on the Inc. 5000 list of America’s fastest-growing private companies. Not to mention the Dallas 100 list of the fastest-growing privately held companies in North Texas for two years in a row.',
		'HOME_PARA2': 'We’ve never set any growth targets, and growth has never been our top priority,” says Sriman Chennareddy, founder and CEO of the Irving, Texas-based company. “Rather, our focus has always been on delivering best-in-class solutions for our clients, on time and on budget. We believe in developing long-term relationships with genuineness and sincerity.',

Or, in the case of end-to-end solutions provider Tekzenit, you find yourself on the Inc. 5000 list of America’s fastest-growing private companies. Not to mention the Dallas 100 list of the fastest-growing privately held companies in North Texas for two years in a row.',
		'TEAM_WELCOME': "Here's our incredible team..",
		'TEAM_PARA1': 'Whether the client is a small business or a global brand, every engagement is a partnership. “Our clients quickly realize we’re very, very serious about doing the right thing for them and very, very serious about doing our best,” Chennareddy says. He says he and his team take as much pride in a website they created for a small, local restaurant as in their ongoing engagements with the United States’ and India’s largest telecommunications companies. Yes, one of India’s largest telecommunications companies. Chennareddy enjoys the irony of an Indian company outsourcing development work to one in the U.S. and says, “Quality, commitment and integrity have always been our guiding principles that have allowed us to attract such great clients.”',
		'GROWTH_HOME': 'Passion Above Growth',
		'GROWTH_PARA1': 'Spend a few minutes talking to Chennareddy about his business, and you’re almost sure to hear the word “passionate.” He’ll tell you how everyone at Tekzenit is “passionate” about the work they do. And that the company makes it a point to hire “passionate” people – who also happen to be supersmart, highly educated and have a “great attitude.”',
		'GROWTH_PARA2': 'For Tekzenit and its employees, loyalty is a two-way street. “We treat our employees really well, and they tend to stay with us a long time,” Chennareddy says. “We give them our best, and we expect the best from them in return.”',
		'GROWTH_PARA3': 'For all his and his company’s success, Chennareddy has never forgotten his roots. He came to the U.S. in 1992 from India to earn a master’s in computer science at Alabama A&M University, moved to Dallas in 1995 looking to start a career, and quickly found work at a small IT consulting firm. That company’s demise in 2000 was the impetus he needed to start his own company. Sixteen years later, Tekzenit has 170 employees at its Irving headquarters and at locations in Braga, Portugal, and Hyderabad, India. And Chennareddy has been recognized as one of the top minority business leaders in North Texas by the Dallas Business Journal. The company has also won dozens of other prestigious design and creative awards.',
		'GROWTH_PARA4': '“Maybe we’d have grown even faster and bigger if we had set aggressive growth targets,” Chennareddy says, “but I don’t think we’d be as happy or as satisfied.” And, ultimately, that’s what’s most important to Chennareddy, his team and, especially, their clients.',
